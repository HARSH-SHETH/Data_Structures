<strong>"Floods"</strong>, we all have heard about it, we all know how disastrous it is. National Geographic site had cited "Floods are among the Earth most common and most destructive natural hazard". Talking about India we all know that Indian streets, cities get flooded easily. In 2019, Only in India 200 people died and millions were displaced. One prime reason for this is that it is very troublesome to locate stranded people in flood. Our project aims to locate and rescue these precious lives.

During massive floods it is risky to send <em>human-help</em> via water-boats for surveillance. So for these regions we can use machines like drones to trace people stranded in floods and send their location back to Rescue-Teams and provide necessities to the person in need.

* Omnidirectional Camera - It will provide a large visual field coverage for surveillance.
* Thermographic Sensor   - It will map the visual field using infrared radiation and the controller can 
                           analyze the data using thermography.
* Microphone and Speaker - For conversation between rescue-team and person.
* GPS-Tracker - To provide the exact co-ordinates of the stranded people.
* Fluorescent Material -  Drone will be visible to the people at night-time. 
* Color - Red color is chosen so that drone will be visible at large extent.

To understand it's basic application let us suppose a situation of a flooded village in which some people are stuck. Instead of doing a manual search rescue teams can employ this drone for surveillance of the region. 
While surveying(using Omnidirectional Camera and Thermographic Sensor) if the operator finds a person it can record the co-ordinates of the person through inbuilt GPS-tracker and send the rescue team to the area. Meanwhile the operator can talk to the stranded person and encourage him to stay relieved. 
This drone would be highly effective at night-time operations in flooded areas.

In future we can add claw like structure to the drone so that it can hold necessities like floating rings, food packets etc.
